# Cats-and-Dogs0

Cat-Dog Classifier using CNN
Overview
Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs

Key Features
Trained a CNN model on a dataset containing cats and dogs images.
Utilized CNN layers for feature extraction and achieved high accuracy in classification.
Provided code for model training, evaluation, and prediction on a test set.
Getting Started
Dataset: Obtain the cats and dogs dataset from [source].
Setup: Install necessary libraries using requirements.txt.
Training: Run train.py to train the model.
Evaluation: Evaluate model accuracy using evaluate.py.
Prediction: Make predictions using predict.py.
Results
Model achieved [mention accuracy]% accuracy on the test set.
Visualizations: Included accuracy/loss plots and sample predictions in the results folder.
Future Enhancements
Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.
Apply transfer learning using pre-trained models for improved performance.
